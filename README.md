# cross-age-face-comparison
Cross Age Face Comparison has become a popular research topic in computer vision and
biometric because traditional Face Recognition systems failed to deal with facial changes
that occur during the aging process that involves types of facial tissues, skin, fat, muscles,
and bones. Therefore, Cross Age Face Comparison has received increasing attention due
to important applications like finding a missing person, identifying criminals,
Government Document verification, image matching, and retrieval, etc. Convolution
Neural Network, which is based on deep learning, is widely used for Facial Analysis.
This dissertation focuses on Cross Age Face Comparison and introduction to traditional
and deep learning-based approaches in the context of similarity measurement. This
dissertation also contains a broad literature survey of state-of-the-art researches that tried
Cross Age Face Recognition/Retrieval and Cross Age Face verification. The dissertation
proposes Siamese Neural network (which consists two sister network and having same
weights) based architecture for cross age face comparison. The proposal is derived after
extensive literature survey and indepth analysis of the existing works. The proposed
architecture is concise and efficient as compared to the state-of-the-art methods proposed
by various researchers. To evaluate the proposed model, we consider FGNET dataset
which is one of the widely used dataset in Cross Age Face Comparison problem. We uses
contrastive loss function to train the model and Euclidean distance to measure similarity
between two face images. Highest achieved accuracy is 98.50% and average accuracy of
best 10 runs is 90.70%.
